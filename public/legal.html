                limiting cookies may impact your ability to use the Service. Here's how to manage cookies in 
                popular browsers:

            <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>
                Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites you visit that 
                you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Currently, there is no standard for how 
                DNT signals should be interpreted. As a result, we do not currently respond to DNT browser 
                signals or mechanisms.
            </p>

            <h2>Cookie Retention</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies have different lifespans:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Temporary cookies that are deleted when you close your browser</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Cookies that remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
